Given a string, return whether or not it forms a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphabetical characters.  

Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards. 

Ex: Given the following strings...

>`"level"`, return `true`  
`"algorithm"`, return `false`  
`"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama."`, return `true`
