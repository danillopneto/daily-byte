# Intersection of Numbers

## This question is asked by `Google`.  

Given two integer arrays, return their intersection.  

Note: the intersection is the set of elements that are common to both arrays.  

Ex: Given the following arrays...  

>`nums1` = `[2, 4, 4, 2]`, `nums2` = `[2, 4]`, return `[2, 4]`  
`nums1` = `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, `nums2` = `[3, 3]`, return `[3]`  
`nums1` = `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, `nums2` = `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, return `[]`
