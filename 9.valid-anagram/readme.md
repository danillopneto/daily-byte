## This question is asked by `Facebook`.  

Given two strings s and t return whether or not `s` is an anagram of `t`.  
Note: An anagram is a word formed by reordering the letters of another word. 


Ex: Given the following string...  

>s = `"cat"`, t = `"tac"`, return `true`  
s = `"listen"`, t = `"silent"`, return `true`  
s = `"program"`, t = `"function"`, return `false`
