# Two Sum

## This question is asked by `Google`.  

Given an array of integers, return whether or not two numbers sum to a given target, `k`.  
Note: you may not sum a number with itself.  

Ex: Given the following...  

>`[1, 3, 8, 2]`, `k = 10`, return `true` (8 + 2)  
`[3, 9, 13, 7]`, `k = 8`, return `false`  
`[4, 2, 6, 5, 2]`, `k = 4`, return `true` (2 + 2)
