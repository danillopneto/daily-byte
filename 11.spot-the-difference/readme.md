# Spot the Difference

## This question is asked by `Google`.  

You are given two strings, `s` and `t` which only consist of lowercase letters.   
`t` is generated by shuffling the letters in `s` as well as potentially adding an additional random character.  
Return the letter that was randomly added to `t` if it exists, otherwise, return `’ ‘`.  


Ex: Given the following strings...  

>`s` = `"foobar"`, `t` = `"barfoot"`, return `'t'`  
`s` = `"ide"`, `t` = `"idea"`, return `'a'`  
`s` = `"coding"`, `t` = `"ingcod"`, return `''`
